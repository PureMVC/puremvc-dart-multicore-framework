--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release Date: 01/15/2013
    Platform: Google Dart
     Version: 2
    Revision: 0
       Minor: 4
     Authors: Cliff Hall <cliff@puremvc.org>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0.4 Replace interface keyword with abstract class for M2
      Add part keywords
      Change Dynamic to dynamic
      
2.0.3 Modify pubspec.yaml again to bump the version number. Doh!

2.0.2 Modify pubspec.yaml to pull in the unit test framework from pub

2.0.1 Code cleanup to keep up with changes in 
	  Dart SDK version 0.2.2.1_r14458. Includes:
	  - Fixed missing 'part of' directives
      - New library and import syntax
      - new getter syntax
      - other minor things like whitespace cleanup
      
2.0   Refactor to meet standards for Dart PubSpec. 
      - library layout changes.
      - inclusion of unit tests (was in a separate project)
      - added pubspec.yaml, README.md
      Also, in the spirit of Dart M1, made the backward incompatible
      change of dropping all the MVC prefixes from the classnames
      in favor of using package prefix in code.
      
1.3   Fixed string concatenation errors in the Framework Validation Page.
      No changes to the framework itself.

1.2   Included .project and .children so that Dart Editor can
	  run the framework verification page (PureMVC_Dart.dart).
	  The need for these files should be eliminated in a future
	  version of the editor, but they are required now.
	  
1.1   Lots of updates and corrections to the documentation.

	  Moved classes and interfaces into the folder locations of the 
	  reference implementation.
	  
	  Updated the Framework Verification Page (PureMVC_Dart.dart/html)
	  to detect errors and give a definitive statement about the 
	  framework's operational status.
	  
	  Also we made the decision to disallow null multiton keys. In the 
	  original ActionScript, this is never a problem, but in the final
	  JavaScript Dart compiles to, contention could arise if multiple 
	  apps by different vendors appear in the same page and both call 
	  Facade.getInstance() without a multiton key. 
	  
1.0   Initial version of Dart MultiCore port on PureMVC.org.
