1.3   Fixed string concatenation errors in the Framework Validation Page.
      No changes to the framework itself.

1.2   Included .project and .children so that Dart Editor can
	  run the framework verification page (PureMVC_Dart.dart).
	  The need for these files should be eliminated in a future
	  version of the editor, but they are required now.
	  
1.1   Lots of updates and corrections to the documentation.

	  Moved classes and interfaces into the folder locations of the 
	  reference implementation.
	  
	  Updated the Framework Verification Page (PureMVC_Dart.dart/html)
	  to detect errors and give a definitive statement about the 
	  framework's operational status.
	  
	  Also we made the decision to disallow null multiton keys. In the 
	  original ActionScript, this is never a problem, but in the final
	  JavaScript Dart compiles to, contention could arise if multiple 
	  apps by different vendors appear in the same page and both call 
	  Facade.getInstance() without a multiton key. 
	  
1.0   Initial version of Dart MultiCore port on PureMVC.org.
