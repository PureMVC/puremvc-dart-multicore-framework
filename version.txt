1.1   Lots of updates and corrections to the documentation.

	  Moved classes and interfaces into the folder locations of the 
	  reference implementation.
	  
	  Updated the Framework Verification Page (PureMVC_Dart.dart/html)
	  to detect errors and give a definitive statement about the 
	  framework's operational status.
	  
	  Also we made the decision to disallow null multiton keys. In the 
	  original ActionScript, this is never a problem, but in the final
	  JavaScript Dart compiles to, contention could arise if multiple 
	  apps by different vendors appear in the same page and both call 
	  Facade.getInstance() without a multiton key. 
	  
1.0   Initial version of Dart MultiCore port on PureMVC.org.
